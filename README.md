## Deploy and Manage Kubernetes at scale



##### Visit "https://k0rdent.github.io/docs/" for the full documentation

k0rdent is dedicated to establishing a standardized and efficient approach to deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters at scale. It functions as a "super control plane," orchestrating and managing multiple Kubernetes control planes seamlessly. Alternatively, k0rdent can be viewed as a powerful open-source platform tailored for Platform Engineering, offering tools to streamline workflows and enhance operational efficiency.

If you are building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), require centralized management of Kubernetes clusters, or wish to create Golden Paths for consistent development practices, k0rdent is an ideal solution. It simplifies complex operations, enabling platform engineers to focus on delivering value.

Whether managing Kubernetes clusters on-premises, in the cloud, or across hybrid environments, k0rdent ensures consistency and reliability. With comprehensive lifecycle management capabilities—including provisioning, configuration, and maintenance—k0rdent provides a repeatable, secure, and centralized method to oversee Kubernetes clusters effectively.
